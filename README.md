# My_Bouncing_Box
----

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>

We defined the (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) at the very top left of your screen.
The box must move diagonally and each time it reaches a border it will change direction of the border it touched.
If the box is moving bottom-right:
-- when it reaches the bottom border it will go top.
-- when it reaches the right border it will go left.
